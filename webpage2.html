<h2>More About Dolphins? </h2>



<p>
Dolphins are probably one of the best known sea mammals. Their popularity may be due to their smiling appearance and friendliness toward humans. Whatever it is, there are hundreds of books about dolphins. 

Try some of these to begin learning about these gentle giants:

Dolphin's First Day by Kathleen Weidner Zoehfeld tells the delightful story of a young bottlenose dolphin. Reviewed by the Smithsonian Institute for accuracy, this beautifully-illustrated book provides wonderful insight about the life of a dolphin calf.

Dolphins by Seymour Simon in partnership with the Smithsonian Institute features gorgeous, full-color photographs along with text that describes the behavior and physical characteristics of dolphins.

The Magic Tree House: Dolphins at Daybreak by Mary Pope Osborne is the perfect fiction book to accompany a study of dolphins for children in the 6- to 9-years-old age range. The ninth book in this wildly popular series features an underwater adventure sure to capture your student's attention.

<h2> How well can dolphins see and hear? </h2>
</br>

<p>Dolphins have excellent eyesight and hearing. Underwater they use echolocation. Echolocation is kind of like sonar where dolphins make a sound and then listen to the echo. Their hearing is so sensitive to these echoes that they can almost "see" objects in the water by hearing. This allows dolphins to locate food in cloudy or dark water.
